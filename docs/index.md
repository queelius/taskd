## API Endpoints

The application provides several API endpoints for managing workspaces and executing scripts. These are defined in [`routes.py`](routes.py).

## Script Execution

Scripts are executed in their respective workspaces. The output of the script execution is logged to a file in the workspace. This is handled by the `execute_script` function in [`utils.py`](utils.py).
